Rust's own standard library is called `std`. It is included with the Rust compiler and is available to all Rust programs. The `std` library provides essential functionality for working with the operating system, file I/O, networking, and more.

The `std` library is divided into modules, each of which contains a set of related functionality. For example, the `std::fs` module contains functions for working with the file system, and the `std::net` module contains functions for working with networking.

To use a module from the `std` library, you need to bring it into scope using the `use` keyword. For example, to use the `std::fs` module, you would write:

```rust
use std::fs;
```

This makes all the functions and types in the `std::fs` module available to your program.

The `std` library is automatically included in every Rust program, so you don't need to add it to your `Cargo.toml` file. You can use the `std` library in your program by simply importing the modules you need.

For more information about the `std` library, check out its [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/).


##### What is a prelude?

The `prelude` is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program. Itâ€™s kept as small as possible, and is focused on things, particularly traits, which are used in almost every single Rust program.
